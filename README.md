# Web Archiver Action

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/your-username/web-archiver-action)](https://github.com/your-username/web-archiver-action/releases)

A reusable GitHub Actions workflow that archives a list of web artifactsâ€”such as websites, file URLs, or subreddit names. It:
- Downloads and archives each artifact (using `wget` for websites/files and a placeholder for subreddits)
- Generates a `README.md` documenting each archived item, the run schedule, and links to download a ZIP of the repository and view the published GitHub Pages site
- Creates an `index.html` linking to the archived artifacts
- Commits the changes to the repository
- Deploys the content (including a dedicated `static` folder) to GitHub Pages
